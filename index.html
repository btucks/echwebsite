            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To grow the game of hockey at all levels, with an emphasis on promoting collegiate hockey for both men and women. College hockey has been producing great hockey players and even better people since its inception, and we hope to spread that awareness nationwide. Attend one college hockey game and feel the school spirit after the home team scores and their fight song echoes throughout the rink. The connection between fans, students, friends, and family with each team is unmatched, and ECH is there to cover every special moment with one of a kind interviews, gameday atmosphere captures, and more.</p>
